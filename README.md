## 100 days CSS challenge
For 100 consecutive days, Matthias Martin wrote snippets of HTML and CSS as a creative learning process for himself. He used CodePen to write and save his code and published his results every day on this website. After the completion of his project on day 100, he rewrote the website for everyone else to join his challenge.
